# movie_zone

A new Flutter application. This is my first ever flutter application and the code is mostly spaghetti, etc. I wrote this app for my bachelor's degree thesis project between the months March to May of 2019. The database used here is Cloud Firestore from the Firebase system. You will need to change a few things to make the app work e.g connecting it to your own firebase project. There is a google authentication system employed here and it works. The email and password system, as well the the facebook OAuth, and Twitter OAuth systems aren't implemented. You can do that on your own. It also uses a Stripe payement system so you can also make your own Stripe account to make it work so that you receive the api secret key. 

This is a cinema reservation app made with dart & flutter. You can add a movie in the cloustore database, you can perform CRUD operations on the movies made available. You can add or delete movies in a favourites or 'watch later' list. You can view trailers, movie ratings and reviews and as well as make your own. You can check a movie's details, screen times, purchase seats, and receive details of purchases. I started learning dart and flutter in January 2019 and by March I started writing code for this app. Again, it is not the most elegant, or even the least, but maybe it can help new developers avoid some of the mistakes I made. I am still making flutter apps and learning more on the framework. More apps will be uploaded in the future. Thanks!
